# DDL To EventStorming

**DDL To EventStorming** feature allows users to input design documents in DDL language, and AI will visualize each model and provide various options for data structures. This enables users to compare and analyze the pros and cons of each option, and provide optimized solutions for requested service areas to generate applications. This feature allows users to proceed with complex projects without manually designing each service area.
