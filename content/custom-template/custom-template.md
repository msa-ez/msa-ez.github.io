# Creating custom templates

## Custom Template

## concept

The custom template adds the desired template in addition to the provided template so that the code can be generated according to the desired template with the EventStorming result.

## Template Description

In order to use the EventStoring result as a desired template, a custom template must be created. Template file is largely divided into two parts, creation-related metadata and source code, and the metadata and source code are divided into “---”.
 
The template creation basically uses the {{ Mustache }} engine, and Mustache is the engine that brings the value in {{ }} as the key value.

## Create a template

Purpose: Creates HelloWorld.py file as an example and displays the names created by using the print function for the results of EventStoming.

1. Create HelloWorld.py file as below.


<pre class=" language-python">

forEach: BoundedContext ----- 1
fileName: HelloWorld.py ----- 2
path: {{boundedContext}}/{{{options.packagePath}}} ----- 3
---
print("BoundedContext: {{name}}");

{{#aggregates}}

print("Aggregate: {{name}}");

{{#events}}

print("event: {{name}}");

{{/events}}

{{#commands}}

print("command: {{name}}");

{{/commands}}

{{#policies}}

print("policy: {{name}}");

{{/policies}}

{{/aggregates}}

</pre>

The value for each metadata can be written by referring to the following.

| Number | Name       | Detail of fuction           |
| -- | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1  | forEach  | The creation unit object of the file. |
| 2  | filename | The name of the file to be created  |
| 3  | path     | path to the file's creation  |

2. Put the created HelloWorld.py file in the ./public/static/template/helloWorld folder.

3. After putting the template, if you check the template selection part in the code     preview, you can see that the HelloWorld template has been added as shown in the figure below.

> <p align="center">그림 HelloWorld 템플릿 선택</p>

4. You can see that a file called HelloWorld.py is created in the folder with each Bounded Context name.

5. Check each of the two HelloWorld.py.

> ![](../../src/img/image68.png)

> ![](../../src/img/image69.png)

You can check that the names of the elements input in each Bounded Context are normally input in the print function.

6. Download the contents of the template and run it.

> ![](../../src/img/image70.png)

> ![](../../src/img/image71.png)

7. Through the created EventStorming, HelloWorld.py is created for each Bounded Context, and you can see that the names of each BoundedContext, Aggregate, Event, Command, and Policy are output in HelloWorld.py.
