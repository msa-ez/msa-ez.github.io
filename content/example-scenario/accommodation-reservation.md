<h3>Event Storming Results</h3>

**[Eventstorming results modeled with MSAEz](http://www.msaez.io/#/storming/QtpQtDiH1Je3wad2QxZUJVvnLzO2/6f36e16efdf8c872da3855fedf7f3ea9)**

**event derivation**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15603058/119298548-337fda80-bc98-11eb-9f96-7d583d156fb9.png)


**Drop out of an ineligible event**

- Filtering out invalid domain events derived during the process
    - Registration>RoomSearched, Reservation>RoomSelected: Excluded because it is a UI event and not a business event

**Easy to read by attaching actors and commands**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15603058/119298993-113a8c80-bc99-11eb-9bae-4b911317d810.png)

**bind with aggregation**

- Room, Reservation, Payment, and Review are grouped together as a unit in which transactions must be maintained by the commands and events associated with them.

**Bind to Bounded Context**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15603058/119300858-6c21b300-bc9c-11eb-9b3f-c85aff51658f.png)

- domain sequence separation 
    - Core Domain: reservation, room: It is an indispensable core service, and the annual Up-time SLA level is set at 99.999%, and the distribution cycle is less than once a week for reservation and less than once a month for room.

    - Supporting Domain: message, viewpage: This is a service for competitiveness, and the SLA level is 60% or more per year uptime goal, and the distribution cycle is autonomous by each team, but the standard sprint cycle is one week, so it is based on at least once a week.

    - General Domain: payment: It is more competitive to use a 3rd party external service as a payment service
 

**Attach the policy (parentheses are the subject of execution, and it does not matter if you attach the policy in the second step. The entire linkage is revealed at the beginning)**

- Add View Model

**Verification that functional/non-functional requirements for the first complete version are**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15603058/119306321-f110ca80-bca4-11eb-804c-a965220bad61.png)

- Register/modify/delete accommodation for the host to rent (ok)
- The customer selects and makes a reservation (ok)
- Payment is made at the same time as the reservation. (ok)
- When a reservation is made, the reservation details (Message) are delivered.(?)
- The customer can cancel the reservation (ok).
- If the reservation is canceled, a cancellation message is sent.(?)
- You can leave a review on the property (ok).
- You can check the overall accommodation information and reservation status on one screen. (Add View-green Sticker is ok)
    
**Modify the model**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15603058/119307481-b740c380-bca6-11eb-9ee6-fda446e299bc.png)
    
- The modified model covers all requirements.

**Verification of non-functional requirements**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15603058/119311800-79df3480-bcac-11eb-9c1b-0382d981f92f.png)

- Transaction processing for scenarios that cross microservices
- Payment processing at the time of customer reservation: ACID transaction is applied by deciding that reservations that have not been paid will never be accepted. When booking is completed, check the room status in advance and process the request-response method for payment processing
- Host connection and reservation processing when payment is completed: Since the room microservice has a separate distribution cycle in the process of transferring the reservation request from reservation to the room microservice, the transaction is processed in the eventual consistency method.
- All other inter-microservice transactions: For all events such as reservation status and post-processing, it is judged that the timing of data consistency is not critical in most cases, so Eventual Consistency is adopted as the default.


**Hexagonal Architecture Diagram Derivation**

![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-3.png)

- Distinguish between inbound adapters and outbound adapters by referring to Chris Richardson, MSA Patterns
- Distinguish between PubSub and Req/Resp in the call relationship
- Separation of sub-domains and bounded contexts: Each team’s KPIs share their interest implementation stories as follows



## avatar

According to the hexagonal architecture derived from the analysis/design phase, microservices represented by each BC were implemented with Spring Boot. The method to run each implemented service locally is as follows (each port number is 8081 ~ 808n)


```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### · CQRS

CQRS was implemented so that customers can inquire about total status such as availability of rooms, reviews and reservations/payments.

- Performance issues can be prevented in advance by integrating individual aggregate status for room, review, reservation, and payment.
- Asynchronously processed and issued event-based Kafka is received/processed and managed in a separate table
- Table modeling (ROOMVIEW)

  ![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-4.png)
- Implemented through viewpage MSA ViewHandler (when “RoomRegistered” event occurs, it is saved in a separate Roomview table based on Pub/Sub)
  ![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-5.png)<br>
  ![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-6.png)
- In fact, if you look up the view page, you can see information such as overall reservation status, payment status, and number of reviews for all rooms.
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31723044/119357063-1b34ad80-bce2-11eb-94fb-a587261ab56f.png)


### · API Gateway
1. After adding the gateway Spring Boot App, add routes for each microservice in application.yaml and set the gateway server port to 8080.

- application.yaml example
```
spring:
  profiles: docker
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: payment
          uri: http://payment:8080
          predicates:
            - Path=/payments/** 
        - id: room
          uri: http://room:8080
          predicates:
            - Path=/rooms/**, /reviews/**, /check/**
        - id: reservation
          uri: http://reservation:8080
          predicates:
            - Path=/reservations/**
        - id: message
          uri: http://message:8080
          predicates:
            - Path=/messages/** 
        - id: viewpage
          uri: http://viewpage:8080
          predicates:
            - Path= /roomviews/**
      globalcors:
        corsConfigurations:
          '[/**]':
            allowedOrigins:
              - "*"
            allowedMethods:
              - "*"
            allowedHeaders:
              - "*"
            allowCredentials: true

server:
  port: 8080            
```

         
2. Write Deployment.yaml for Kubernetes and create Deploy on Kubernetes
- Deployment.yaml example


```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: gateway
  namespace: airbnb
  labels:
    app: gateway
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: gateway
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: gateway
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: gateway
          image: 247785678011.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gateway:1.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```               



- Create a Deploy
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```     
- Deploy created in Kubernetes. Confirm
            
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80744273/119321943-1d821200-bcb8-11eb-98d7-bf8def9ebf80.png)
	    
            
3. Create a Service.yaml for Kubernetes and create a Service/LoadBalancer in Kubernetes to check the Gateway endpoint
- Service.yaml example

```
apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: gateway
    namespace: airbnb
    labels:
      app: gateway
  spec:
    ports:
      - port: 8080
        targetPort: 8080
    selector:
      app: gateway
    type:
      LoadBalancer           
```             


- Create Service
```
kubectl apply -f service.yaml            
```             


- Check API Gateway endpoint 
- Check Service and endpoint 
```
kubectl get svc -n airbnb           
```                 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80744273/119318358-2a046b80-bcb4-11eb-9d46-ef2d498c2cff.png)

## Correlation

In the Airbnb project, the Correlation-key implementation for distinguishing the type of processing in PolicyHandler is passed as a variable in the event class to accurately implement the related processing between services.

Take a look at the implementation example below

When you make a reservation, the status of services such as room and payment are appropriately changed at the same time. You can check that the data such as the state value is changed to the appropriate state.

### · Synchronous call (Sync) and Fallback handling

As one of the conditions in the analysis stage, it was decided to process the reservation availability status check call between rooms when making a reservation as a transaction that maintains synchronous consistency. The calling protocol allows the REST service already exposed by the Rest Repository to be called using FeignClient. Also, the reservation -> payment service was decided to be processed synchronously.

- Implement the service proxy interface (Proxy) using stub and (FeignClient) to call the room and payment service

```
# PaymentService.java

package airbnb.external;

<omit the import statement>

@FeignClient(name="Payment", url="${prop.room.url}")
public interface PaymentService {

    @RequestMapping(method= RequestMethod.POST, path="/payments")
    public void approvePayment(@RequestBody Payment payment);

}

# RoomService.java

package airbnb.external;

<omit the import statement>

@FeignClient(name="Room", url="${prop.room.url}")
public interface RoomService {

    @RequestMapping(method= RequestMethod.GET, path="/check/chkAndReqReserve")
    public boolean chkAndReqReserve(@RequestParam("roomId") long roomId);

}


```

- Immediately after receiving the reservation request (@PostPersist), check the availability and process the payment request synchronously (Sync)
```
# Reservation.java (Entity)

    @PostPersist
    public void onPostPersist(){

        ////////////////////////////////
        // When INSERTed into RESERVATION
        ////////////////////////////////

        ////////////////////////////////////
        // When a reservation request (reqReserve) is received
        ////////////////////////////////////

        // Check if the ROOM is available
        boolean result = ReservationApplication.applicationContext.getBean(airbnb.external.RoomService.class)
                        .chkAndReqReserve(this.getRoomId());
        System.out.println("######## Check Result : " + result);

        if(result) { 

            // If reservation is available

            //////////////////////////////
            // PAYMENT payment in progress (POST method) - SYNC call
            //////////////////////////////
            airbnb.external.Payment payment = new airbnb.external.Payment();
            payment.setRsvId(this.getRsvId());
            payment.setRoomId(this.getRoomId());
            payment.setStatus("paid");
            ReservationApplication.applicationContext.getBean(airbnb.external.PaymentService.class)
                .approvePayment(payment);

            /////////////////////////////////////
            // Event publication --> ReservationCreated
            /////////////////////////////////////
            ReservationCreated reservationCreated = new ReservationCreated();
            BeanUtils.copyProperties(this, reservationCreated);
            reservationCreated.publishAfterCommit();
        }
    }
```

- Confirm that synchronous calls result in time coupling with the time of the call, and that orders cannot be taken if the payment system fails:


```
# Pause the pay service temporarily (ctrl+c)

# Reservation request
http POST http://localhost:8088/reservations roomId=1 status=reqReserve   #Fail

# Restart payment service
cd payment
mvn spring-boot:run

# Reservation request
http POST http://localhost:8088/reservations roomId=1 status=reqReserve   #Success
```

- Also, in case of excessive request, service failure can occur like dominoes. (Circuit breaker and fallback processing will be explained in the operation phase.)




### · Asynchronous Invocation / Temporal Decoupling / Failure Isolation / Eventual Consistency Test


After payment is made, the status of the accommodation system is updated, the status of the reservation system is updated, and communication with the system to which reservation and cancellation messages are transmitted is handled asynchronously.
 
- For this, when the payment is approved, an event indicating that the payment has been approved is transmitted to Kafka. (Publish)
 
```
# Payment.java

package airbnb;

import javax.persistence.*;
import org.springframework.beans.BeanUtils;

@Entity
@Table(name="Payment_table")
public class Payment {

    ....

    @PostPersist
    public void onPostPersist(){
        ////////////////////////////
        // If payment is approved
        ////////////////////////////

        // Event publication -> PaymentApproved
        PaymentApproved paymentApproved = new PaymentApproved();
        BeanUtils.copyProperties(this, paymentApproved);
        paymentApproved.publishAfterCommit();
    }
    
    ....
}
```

- Reservation system implements PolicyHandler to receive payment approval event and handle its own policy:

```
# Reservation.java

package airbnb;

    @PostUpdate
    public void onPostUpdate(){
    
        ....

        if(this.getStatus().equals("reserved")) {

            ////////////////////
            // When the reservation is confirmed
            ////////////////////

            // event occurs --> ReservationConfirmed
            ReservationConfirmed reservationConfirmed = new ReservationConfirmed();
            BeanUtils.copyProperties(this, reservationConfirmed);
            reservationConfirmed.publishAfterCommit();
        }
        
        ....
        
    }

```

Other message services are completely separated from reservation/payment and are processed according to event reception, so there is no problem in receiving reservations even if the message service is temporarily down due to maintenance.

```
# Pause message service (ctrl+c)

# Reservation request
http POST http://localhost:8088/reservations roomId=1 status=reqReserve   #Success

# Check your reservation status
http GET localhost:8088/reservations    #Regardless of the message service, the reservation status is normal

```

## operation

### · Synchronous Call / Circuit Breaking / Fault Isolation

* Circuit Breaking Framework of choice: implemented using istio

The scenario is implemented by linking the connection at reservation--> room with RESTful Request/Response, and when the reservation request is excessive, fault isolation through CB.

- Create a DestinationRule to allow circuit break to occur. Set a minimum connection pool.

```
# destination-rule.yml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: dr-room
  namespace: airbnb
spec:
  host: room
  trafficPolicy:
    connectionPool:
      http:
        http1MaxPendingRequests: 1
        maxRequestsPerConnection: 1
#    outlierDetection:
#      interval: 1s
#      consecutiveErrors: 1
#      baseEjectionTime: 10s
#      maxEjectionPercent: 100
```

* Activate istio-injection and check the room pod container

```
kubectl get ns -L istio-injection
kubectl label namespace airbnb istio-injection=enabled 
```

![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-14.png)


* Check circuit breaker operation with load tester siege tool:

run siege

```
kubectl run siege --image=apexacme/siege-nginx -n airbnb
kubectl exec -it siege -c siege -n airbnb -- /bin/bash
```


- When load is created with concurrent user 1, everything is normal.
```
siege -c1 -t10S -v --content-type "application/json" 'http://room:8080/rooms POST {"desc": "Beautiful House3"}'

```

- The operating system does not die and continuously shows that the circuit is properly opened and closed by CB to protect the resource. Post-processing to expand the system through virtualhost configuration and dynamic scale out (automatic addition of replica, HPA) is required.


**Auto Scale Out Previously**
CB enabled stable operation of the system, but it did not accept 100% of the user's request, so we want to apply an automated extension function as a complement to this.

- Add resources configuration to room deployment.yml file
![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-16.png)

- Configure HPA to dynamically grow replicas for the room service. The setting increases the number of replicas to 10 when CPU usage exceeds 50%:
```
kubectl autoscale deployment room -n airbnb --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
```
![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-17.png)

- Load 100 concurrent users for 1 minute.
```
siege -c100 -t60S -v --content-type "application/json" 'http://room:8080/rooms POST {"desc": "Beautiful House3"}'
```
- Monitor how the autoscale is going
```
kubectl get deploy room -w -n airbnb 
```
- After some time (about 30 seconds) you can see the scale out occurs:
![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-18.png)

- If you look at the log of siege, you can see that the overall success rate has increased.

### · Uninterrupted redistribution

* First, remove Autoscaler or CB settings to check whether non-stop redistribution is 100%.

```
kubectl delete destinationrules dr-room -n airbnb
kubectl label namespace airbnb istio-injection-
kubectl delete hpa room -n airbnb
```

- Monitoring the workload right before deployment with seige.
```
siege -c100 -t60S -r10 -v --content-type "application/json" 'http://room:8080/rooms POST {"desc": "Beautiful House3"}'

```

- Start deploying to a new version
```
kubectl set image ...
```

- Go to seige's screen and check if Availability has dropped below 100%

```

```
- During the distribution period, it was confirmed that the availability fell from 100% to 87%. The reason is that Kubernetes recognized the newly uploaded service as a READY state and proceeded to introduce the service. To prevent this, readiness probe is set.

```
# Configure readiness probe in deployment.yaml:
```

![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-19.png)

```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yml
```

- Check Availability after redeploying with the same scenario:

Uninterrupted redistribution is confirmed to be successful because availability does not change during the distribution period.


## Self-healing (Liveness Probe)
- Edit room deployment.yml file
```
After running the container, create a /tmp/healthy file
Delete after 90 seconds
Make livenessProbe validate with 'cat /tmp/healthy'
```
![image](../../src/img/example/hotel/hotel-20.png)

- Check by running kubectl describe pod room -n airbnb
```
After 90 seconds of running the container, the driver is normal, but after that, the /tmp/healthy file is deleted and livenessProbe returns a failure.
If the pod is in a normal state, enter the pod and create a /tmp/healthy file to maintain the normal state.
